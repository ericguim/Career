# Career

This is a learning repository.
I'm currently working as a software engineer, but I wish working with physics in the future.
So, I decided to create this repository to improve my Hard Skills and get close to some technologies and techniques which are commonly used in Physics research.

In this repo i'll add:

> **Challenges resolved in C++**
>
> **Code for GPU in C++**
>
> **Basic and Advanced C++ coding**

## Structure to see what was done:

### /cpp/

- [ ] **/cpp/minus-plus-problem/**
  > Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and are zeros. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.
- [ ] **/cpp/two-elements-add-up-to-k/**
  > This problem was recently asked by Google. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17
  
  > Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?
- [ ] **/cpp/well-formed-expression/**
  > Problem presented in a Software Engineer interview on Facebook: Given a string with expressions open and closed by square brackets, parentheses and braces, return true if the formation is correct or false otherwise
- [ ] **/cpp/binary-search/** 
  > binary-search
- [ ] **/cpp/simple-recursion/**
  > simple recursion
- [ ] **/cpp/finding-duplicate-elements/**
  > Given that we have 3 arrays of integers, how can we find duplicate integers in at least two arrays
- [ ] **/cpp/quicksort/**
  > sorting numbers with quicksort algorithm

### /gpu/

``` sh
In the first momment, 
Iâ€™ll rewrite some of the cpp challenges, but to run on the GPU
```
